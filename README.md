# An-Automated-Disease-Prognosis-Tool-Towards-Using-Hybrid-Architecture-of-Deep-Learning-Paradigm
The Covid 19 beta coronavirus, commonly known
as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-
2), is currently one of the most significant RNA-type
viruses in human health. However, more such epidemics occurred
beforehand because they were not limited. Much research has
recently been carried out on classifying the disease. Still, no
automated diagnostic tools have been developed to identify
multiple diseases using X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT)
scan, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. In this
research, several Tate-of-the-art techniques have been applied to
the Chest-Xray, CT scan, and MRI segmented images’ datasets
and trained them simultaneously. Deep learning models based
on VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, Capsule Network,
DenseNet architecture, Exception and Optimized Convolutional
Neural Network (Optimized CNN) were applied to the detecting
of Covid-19 contaminated situation, Alzheimer’s disease, and
Lung infected tissues. Due to efforts taken to reduce model losses
and overfitting, the models’ performances have improved in terms
of accuracy. With the use of image augmentation techniques like
flip-up, flip-down, flip-left, flip-right, etc., the size of the training
dataset was further increased. In addition, we have proposed a
mobile application by integrating a deep learning model to make
the diagnosis faster. Eventually, we applied the Image fusion
technique to analyze the medical images by extracting meaningful
insights from the multimodal imaging modalities.
